# CRUD application with ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MySQL

#### You will need to have Node > 14.0 and npm > 5.6 to create your project. 

$ npm create-react-app client
$ cd client
npm start 

#### Create React App doesnâ€™t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline into client folder, so you can use it with any backend you want. The server folder would be handle with the backend.
